# Supervised Machine Learning Course by Andrew Ng

## Course Overview

This course is part of the Machine Learning Specialization.

## Week 1: Introduction to Supervised Learning

### Key Concepts

- Definition & Examples of Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression with One Variable
- Hypothesis Function
- Cost Function
- Gradient Descent
- Learning Rate

### Notes

- Cost Function for Linear Regression

```octave
J(theta) = 1/2m * sum((h(x) - y)^2)
```

- Gradient Descent for Linear Regression

```octave
theta = theta - alpha * 1/m * sum((h(x) - y) * x)
```

- We must update all thetas simultaneously

- Batch Gradient Descent: Each step of gradient descent uses all the training examples

## Week 2: Linear Regression
